VOLDEMORT (VDM)

This source tree contains the public version of VOLDEMORT (VDM), the VA's tool for comparing the setup of any VistA system against a GOLD master. 

Notes:
- Two GOLDs: for OSEHRA, GOLD VistA will be a cleaned up version of FOIA. The VA's internal GOLD will also have proprietary elements not available on OSEHRA and not present in FOIA.
- VDM version 1 is scheduled for release in December 2012. Between then and now, new reports and code upgrades will be posted in the VOLDEMORT github
- VDM relies on FMQL, the FileMan Query Language to download system meta data from a VistA. FMQL is available at: http://www.caregraf.org/semanticvista/fmql#fmqlrelease
