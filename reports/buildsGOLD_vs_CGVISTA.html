The non-standard use of TMP by the MHV log causesthe TMP entries to not be cleaned up automatically.This patch will turn off logging in the HL7 receiver routines allowing itto be switched on and off externally as designed.  An XTMP global will beused instead of TMP.  Options will be added to control logging and tofacilitate automatically purging the log.  A post-init will run to cleanup any existing TMP("MHV7LOG") entries. A new menu, MHV LOG MENU, has been added.  The log provides information of use to MHV developers, and should only be used by IRM staff in the event troubleshooting an MHV interface becomes necessary.  The MHV user manual provides information on how to use these options.Included options are:        MHV LOG CONFIG     Configure Logging Parameters        MHV LOG INFO       Display Log Information        MHV LOG OFF        Turn Off Log</td></tr><tr id='TIU*1.0*218'><td>6402</td><td>TIU*1.0*218<br/>TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES</td><td>2006-07-26<br/>2006-08-07</td><td>NATIONAL<br/>SINGLE PACKAGE<br/>0/1/0/0/0</td><td>The description of this patch may be found in the national patch module under patch TIU*1.0*218.</td></tr><tr id='FB*3.5*97'><td>6403</td><td>FB*3.5*97<br/>FEE BASIS</td><td>2006-05-30<br/>2006-08-07</td><td>NATIONAL<br/>SINGLE PACKAGE<br/>0/1/0/0/0</td><td>  This patch is issued to compensate for the longer MRA message to be received from Austin Central Fee.

It will be sorted by division. The report will contain the orderable item name, dispense drug name, prescription number and the internal entry number (IEN) of the entry from the ORDERS file (#100) as well as other information about the patient and order.

The recently released patch PSD*3*69 introduced a new key PSD TECH ADV,   intended to allow a Controlled Substances technician access to some of   the Pharmacist's menu as described in the PSD*3*69 patch description.   Some users have expressed concerns related to the Outpatient Rx's [PSD   OUTPATIENT] option because the new PSD TECH ADV key was supposed to   allow the posting of the transaction but not allow the release of the   prescription. This patch will now allow a holder of the PSD TECH ADV   key to perform all the functionalities of the Outpatient Rx's [PSD    OUTPATIENT] option EXCEPT releasing prescriptions. 2.
