When the .01 field and several required identifier fields on a fileare flagged to be audited, and a new entry is added to the file, the auditinformation for the .01 field is recorded in the AUDIT file last--afterthe audit information of the required identifiers.  The resulting sequenceof audit records for the .01 field and the required identifers do notreflect the actual sequence of data filing. This patch corrects thisproblem by recording the audit information for the .01 field as its datais filed, prior to the processing of the required identifiers. (DICN,DIET)  2.  Change to online help when adding a new record to a file.  If youenter a new value at the 'Select ...:' prompt, FileMan asks 'Are youadding ... as a new ...?'
